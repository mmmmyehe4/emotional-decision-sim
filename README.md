# Responsibility-Based Ontology Simulator

> Emotion → Judgment → Choice → Responsibility → Existence

A simulation project that models how human existence is shaped by emotion-based decision-making and responsibility.

### Concept
Built on a personal philosophy theory developed by a Korean student (me!), this simulator is designed to:

- Demonstrate how emotional and rational responses are weighed
- Show how choice leads to responsibility
- Explore how responsibility defines human existence
- Contrast human and AI decision structures

### Structure (WIP)
1. User inputs a life event (e.g. "My friend was late")
2. Context: wait time, contact, emotional state
3. System calculates:
   - Emotion Weight
   - Logic Weight
4. Decision pathway determined by dominant weight
5. Outcome simulated
6. User chooses how to take responsibility
7. Existence state evolves

### Why this matters
Unlike AI, humans don't just learn from outcomes—we carry them.

### Looking for
A dev who finds this intellectually fun, emotionally curious, and maybe even a little existentially chaotic.
